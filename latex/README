The JCSE template and its provided LaTeX sample, sample.tex has been tested on
KoTeXLive (Windows, kotexlive2010-full.exe, ktug.or.kr),
on Ubuntu 10.04, Arch Linux environment.



On Windows, with KoTeXLive environment, sample.tex should compile
seamlessly with pdfLaTeX compile command from TeXworks -
eps figures will be automatically converted to PDF format.



Tested on Ubuntu 10.04 with latex command, with texlive-full package installed.
Type following sequence of commands to generate pdf output:

latex sample
bibtex sample
latex sample
latex sample
dvipdf sample.dvi



Tested on Arch Linux (2011-05-22), with texlive-most package installed.
On Arch Linux, pdflatex command can handle epsfig command automatically by
converting eps to pdf files. The following commands will generate
pdf output directly:

pdflatex sample
bibtex sample
pdflatex sample

or, with provided Makefile:

make
